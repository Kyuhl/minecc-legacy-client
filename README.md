MineCC Legacy: Client
====================

Code for the MineCC Client, so that everybody can see how it worked and examine the code. Unfortunately the Server code has been lost forever and will likely never be seen again, much like MineCC itself. ;_;

If you, for some reason, want to document this code, go ahead - I'll accept pull requests as long as they're not blatantly wrong or horrible.


¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
That's about it folks.
